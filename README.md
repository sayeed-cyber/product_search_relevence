# product search relevance rate system

This program actually predicts relevancy between costumer searched product and result product 

A machine learning program that generates data points of products and uses linear regression to make predictions based on customer search patterns. 

## Data Generation
The program generates data points with the following features:
- Brands
- Categories
- Colors
- Materials
- Gender

Each product is also assigned a relevance score based on customer search patterns.

## Training
The program trains itself using the generated data and linear regression, allowing it to make predictions based on customer search queries. 

## Prediction
When a customer search query is inputted, the program outputs a list of product descriptions with the highest relevance scores.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn (Linear Regression)

## Benefits
- The program is able to provide customers with relevant product recommendations based on their search queries, increasing the chances of making a sale. 
- The more data the program generates and trains on, the more accurate its predictions become, leading to a better customer experience. 
- The use of linear regression allows for efficient and effective training, making it a scalable solution for even the largest of datasets.

## Future Work
- The program can be improved by incorporating other machine learning algorithms, such as decision trees or neural networks, to further increase its accuracy. 
- The addition of user-specific data, such as purchase history or browsing behavior, can also enhance the relevance of product recommendations. 

Overall, this product recommendation system is a valuable tool for businesses looking to improve their customer experience and increase sales.


## Deployment
The program can be deployed in a variety of ways, including as a standalone application or integrated into an e-commerce website or mobile app. 

## User Interaction
Users can input their search queries, and the program will output a list of product descriptions with the highest relevance scores. Users can then select a product to view its full description and make a purchase if desired. 

## Customization
The program can be easily customized to meet the specific needs of a business. This includes modifying the features used for data generation, adjusting the relevance scoring algorithm, and integrating with existing systems such as a database or e-commerce platform.

## Conclusion
This product recommendation system is a powerful tool that can help businesses to better understand their customers and provide them with relevant and personalized product recommendations. Whether deployed as a standalone solution or integrated into an existing system, the program is sure to bring value to any business looking to improve the customer experience and increase sales.
